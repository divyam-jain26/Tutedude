# Task 1
**Functionality of the Program**

This program **checks whether a given number is even or odd**. Its functionality is:

1. It **takes an integer input** from the user and stores it in the variable `x`.
2. It **uses the modulus operator (`%`)** to find the remainder when `x` is divided by 2.
3. If the remainder is **0**, the number is identified as **even**.
4. Otherwise, the number is identified as **odd**.
5. It **displays the result** indicating whether the entered number is even or odd.

In summary, the program reads a number from the user and determines its **parity (even or odd)**.

# Task 2
**Functionality of the Program**

This program **calculates the sum of the first 50 natural numbers**. Its functionality is:

1. It **initializes a variable `sum` to 0** to store the running total.
2. It **uses a `for` loop** to iterate through numbers from **1 to 50**.
3. In each iteration, the current number is **added to `sum`**.
4. After the loop completes, it **prints the total sum** of all numbers from 1 to 50.

In summary, the program computes and displays the **sum of integers from 1 through 50**.
