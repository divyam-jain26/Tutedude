# Task 1
**Functionality of the Program**

This program **calculates the factorial of a given number**. Its functionality is:

1. It **defines a function `factorial(num)`** that computes the factorial of a number.

   * The variable `result` is initialized to 1.
   * A `for` loop multiplies `result` by every integer from **2 to `num`**.
   * The final factorial value is returned.
2. The program **takes an integer input** from the user.
3. It **calls the `factorial` function** with the user-provided number.
4. It **displays the factorial result** using formatted output.

In summary, the program accepts a number from the user and prints its **factorial**, calculated using an iterative approach.

# Task 2
**Functionality of the Program**

This program **performs mathematical operations using built-in math functions**. Its functionality is:

1. It **imports mathematical functions** `sqrt`, `log`, and `sin` from the `math` module.
2. It **takes an integer input** from the user and stores it in the variable `i`.
3. It **calculates and displays**:

   * The **square root** of the number.
   * The **natural logarithm** (base *e*) of the number.
   * The **sine** of the number (input interpreted in **radians**).
4. The results are **printed in a formatted, multi-line output**.

In summary, the program accepts a number and outputs its **square root, natural logarithm, and sine value** using Python’s math library.
